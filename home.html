                <p>
                    The World Happiness index was recently developed to show how a nation’s happiness is determined 
                    by certain socio-economic, health and political factors. This new index is now being used 
                    by policy makers, governments and other stakeholders in making national decisions. The sub-indicators 
                    that sum up to make the Happiness index includes GDP Per Capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, 
                    freedom to make life choices, perception of corruption and generosity. 
                    
                    The Sustainable Development Index is calculated annually to show how countries are progressing 
                    towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals by 2030. This project uses several 
                    visualizations to show the relationship between countries’ level of development and the happiness 
                    of their citizens. From the analysis of data, it was found that countries that were in the 10th 
                    percentile in the sustainable development ranking also had the highest levels of happiness. 
                    This technical report will discuss the objectives of the project, methodology and findings 
                    from the analysis.
