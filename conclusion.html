                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    The data first revealed that most of the countries that ranked highest in the happiness index were 
                    also the same as countries that scored highest in achieving the SDGs. There is 
                    also a similar observation with GDP per capita, more developed countries especially OECD countries had higher per capita GDP. 
                    However, other sub-indicators like (trust) perception of corruption was low in most countries. Also, in more developed 
                    countries, life expectancy was higher as well as social support, this result is not surprising because of 
                    the advanced technological and infrastructural development in these countries. 
                    
                    In conclusion, there seems to be a direct positive relationship between happiness and development, 
                    however, a statistical test such as correlation will be useful in proving this relationship.
